# Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Console
For this project, the classic game of rock, paper, and scissors is played entirely in the console. The goal of the project is to build a simple project using beginner knowledge of Javascript. Later on, additional Javascript may be added to make the project more complex in scope.

## The Game
The game will be played in a best of 5 rounds. For each round, a prompt is given asking the player to select a choice out of rock, paper, or scissors. The console will output the round winner and continue until 5 rounds have pasted. The final winner will be outputted to console once the game is over. To restart the game, the player will have to reload the page.

Note that the prompt can accept choices outside of the standard "rock", "paper", or "scissors", but will result in an immediate round end where neither player or computer wins.
